At CMS the LHC bunches of protons collide every 25 ns; CMS detect
every product of those collisions at the same incredible rate; the
corresponding data traffic (tens of TB/sec) cannot be gathered and
stored, a tight selection needs to be applied. Currently CMS throws
away more than 99.99% of events based on a strong prejudice about what
are the features of those worth being studied offline. It is not
impossible that such bias is limiting the sensitivity of the
experiment to New Physics.
The L1 Scouting project aims at elaborating and analyzing the data
from the L1 trigger system (i.e. physics objects reconstructed with
limited accuracy) prior to any filter, reducing to almost zero the
bias with which the LHC collisions are scrutinized.
This requires the development of dedicated electronic boards, network
protocols, online processing systems (both hardware and software) and
a strategy to improve the accuracy of the information provide by the
L1 trigger.
We have developed and it is currently in operation a
proof-of-principle setup; in the meanwhile we are developing the
hardware for the future upgrade of the LHC and CMS, which will benefit
from a completly renewed L1 trigger system, featuring state-of-the-art
tecnologies.
