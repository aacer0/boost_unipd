One can thing that the core of the scientific method, i.e. checking
whether a given hypothesis is compatible with the measurements, is a
straightforward operation. That is very far from being true, it is in
fact one of the hardest problem in data analysis. HEP experiments
typically compare two hypotheses, the Standard Model and an
alternative physics model extending the latter. What if one wants to
be sensitive to phenomena not described by the SM without formulating
an explicit alternative model? That is what New Physics Machine
Learning (NPLM) does, an powerful and statistically sound method to detect
anomalies in the data, i.e. features departing from the expectaion.
NPLM can be applied in HEP experiments as well as in other domains.
Our group is the main contributor to the project and after several
years of development and tests, we are putting it in production,
specifically using it as alternative test statistics for CMS analyses.
