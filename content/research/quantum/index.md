Quantum-inspired algorithms are an exciting alternative option for computational tasks usually addressed by standard machine learning techniques. In our group, we focus on the development of Tree Tensor Networks for HEP applications, specifically to enhance the capabilities of online data processing systems like those exploited at the first trigger levels of collider experiments. The main goal is to implement tensor network models and state-vector simulators on FPGA.
