The physics program of the CMS experiment is rich and includes in
particular the precise assesment of the properties of the Higgs
boson. Our group has an history of succesfull analyses concerning New
Physics searches and rare Higgs decays like the one to a photon and
pair of muons stemming from a J/psi. 
Some of measurements cannot however be tackled in the standard
way as the corresponding final state are too common and an unprescaled trigger
is very hard to be put in production. We plan to leverage on the L1
Scouting infrastructure to pursue the such challenging analyses;
examples of these are the decay of the Higgs into four charged kaons
via a pair of phi mesons and the decay of the W boson into three
charged pions.
