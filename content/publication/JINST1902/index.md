  The Level-1 trigger scouting system of the CMS experiment aims at intercepting the intermediate data produced by the L1 trigger processors before the final trigger decision. This system can be complemented by adding the raw stream of data collected from the detector front-end, whenever the throughput is manageable. In this work, the triggerless readout of the CMS Drift Tubes (DT) detector is presented. This is realized by reading a sector of the DT which has been equipped with the preproduction of Phase-2 upgrade front-end boards. A Xilinx VCU118 acts as a concentrator of the Phase-2 demonstrator lpGBT links and transmits data to a server via 100G TCP/IP. First results coming from a test-stand mimicking the sector demonstrator are shown.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "The first deployment of the trigger-less data acquisition pipeline including a 100G TCP/IP link to process the data of the upgraded electronics of the Drift Tube detector of the CMS collaboration"
