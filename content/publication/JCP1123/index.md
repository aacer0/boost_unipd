abstract: >
  We report the first ever measurements of the thermalization length
  of low-energy electrons injected into solid para-hydrogen at a
  temperature T about 2.8 K. The use of the pulsed Townsend photoinjection
  technique has allowed us to investigate the behavior of quasi-free
  electrons rather than of massive, slow negative charges, as reported
  in all previous literature. We have found an average thermalization
  length z0 = 26.1 nm, which is three to five times longer than that
  in liquid helium at the same temperature.
