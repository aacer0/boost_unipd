abstract: >
 The CMS experiment 40 MHz data scouting project is aimed at intercepting the data produced at the level of the detectors’ front-end without the filters induced by hardware-based triggers. A first implementation is realized by the trigger-less reading and processing of a fraction of the Drift Tube (DT) muon detector, equipped with a preliminary version of the so-called Phase-2 Upgrade on-detector electronics boards. The data are transferred via high-speed optical links to back-end boards independently from the central experiment data acquisition (DAQ), permitting real-time detector status monitoring via receiving all the signals produced at the front-end level, and providing an unbiased estimate of the CMS DT hit-rate under various data-taking conditions.
