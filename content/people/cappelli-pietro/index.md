Pietro Cappelli is a Physics of Data student at the University of
Padova with a backgroud in Phyisics. Pietro's interests are primarily
focused on Physics of High Energy and data analysis, in particular
applied in the context of the latter Physics' field. During his period
of study in the master degree course, he contribute to some projects
concerning machine learning tools applied to High Energy physics. In
the Bachelor thesis, done in Ferrara, he studied the phenomenon of
neutrino decoupling, by computing the right hand side of the Boltzmann
equation, with numerical integration.
