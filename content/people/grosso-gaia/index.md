Gaia is currently a PhD student at the University of Padua (2019-2023) and a member of the mPP ERC-funded group at CERN, developing machine learning applications for high-energy physics. Her research activity deals with statistical tools for data analysis at collider experiments, with focus on model agnostic searches for new phenomena at the LHC. She is member of the CMS collaboration at CERN since 2019. From September 2023 she will be joining the IAIFI (https://iaifi.org/) group in Boston as a fellow, to further investigate ML based methods for offline model-independent new physics searches and to explore approaches of online anomaly detection and physics analysis.
