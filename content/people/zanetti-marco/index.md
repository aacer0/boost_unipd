Marco Zanetti is a full professor at the Department of Physics
and Astronomy at the University of Padova. He conceived and now
coordinates the master program in Physics of Data.

A member of the CMS experiment at CERN, he participated in the
discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Since then, he has been looking
for Physics not explained by the Standard Model, developing technical
and statistical tools allowing reducing the bias which affects the
way novel phenomena are looked for.
