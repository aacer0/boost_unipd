Alberto Zucchetta is a staff researcher at the INFN Sezione di Padova.

Member of the CMS Collaborations since 2011, he obtained his PhD in Physics at the University of Padua in 2015, and then spent one year at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, within an INFN-CERN collaboration program. During this period, he contributed to several searches for new massive and Dark Matter particles, focusing on boosted topologies with W, Z, and Higgs bosons.
From 2016 to 2019, he joined the CMS group of the University of Zurich (UZH), working on physics analyses and on the simulation and the commissioning of the upgraded CMS pixel detector, installed in 2017.
Since 2019, he has been a staff researcher at the INFN Padova.

His reasearch interests consist in searches for very rare decay modes of the Standard Model Higgs and Z bosons, and the application of machine learning algorithms to medicine.
