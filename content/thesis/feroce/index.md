The constant trend in producing larger and larger dataset is evident in almost every field of experimental physics. This need is heightened in experiments that, for reducing inefficiencies or for not being constrained by restricted latency budgets, decide to run without a hardware trigger system. The processing power is of paramount importance for the computing farm called to process the dataset eventually, but an inefficient data movement often weakens it. 

The challenge of moving large quantity of data can be tackled employing network protocol based on the concept of remote direct memory access. This would unburden the processor from the low level management of the data movement and protocol stack stripping, but it would require a more intelligent hardware on the front end side. The activities will be focused around the implementation of a demonstrator of an innovative DAQ implemented by means of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
