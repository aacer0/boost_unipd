The CMS experiment is developing and testing a data acquisition
infrastructure to continuously read out and process detector
data (L1-scouting). This offers the possibility to examine the LHC collisions
without the bias introduced by the trigger selection. In order to
fully profit from that, a statistical strategy has to be deployed,
allowing the search for unexpected phenomena that doesn't
rely on a pre-defined physical model. New Physics Learning Machine
(NPLM) is a method developed by our group aiming precisely at that.
The thesis work concerns the application of NPLM to the data acquired
by the L1-scouting during the current LHC run and in particular on the
Muon candidates reconstructed by the Global Muon Trigger; that is the
first such an attempt is made, thus a thorough validation is required.
The work will be done in collaboration with our PhD students and our
colleagues at CERN.
