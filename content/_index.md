        <div style="font-size:large">You canâ€™t do inference or data compression without making hypotheses.
        But every hypotheses will influence the information extracted from the data.

        In order to reduce the bias with which the data are analyzed, one should be well aware about the underlying assumptions 
        and at the same time those should be kept to the essential.
        This attitude requires advanced technological and statistical tools to tackle the arduous challenges posed by the management, processing and analysis of large and complex datasets.

        This is the core business of **BOOST** (Boost Online Operations with advanced Statistics and Technology).
        Our main applications are in **High Energy Physics** and **Data-Driven Medicine**.</div>
