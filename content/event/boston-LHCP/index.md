summary: LHC Physics Conference, 2024 edition.
abstract: 'The Large Hadron Collider Physics (LHCP) conference series started in 2013 after a successful fusion of two international conferences, "Physics at Large Hadron Collider Conference" and "Hadron Collider Physics Symposium". The program of this edition will contain a detailed review of the latest experimental and theoretical results on collider physics, with many final results of the Large Hadron Collider Run 2, potentially a first glimpse of the upgraded accelerator and detector operation in Run 3, and discussions on further research directions within the high energy particle physics community, both in theory and experiment.'
