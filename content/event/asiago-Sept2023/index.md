summary: The second September workshop of Physics of Data with keynote speakers and alumni.
abstract: 'The modeling and the theoretical interpretation of complex natural phenomena from large amounts of data are at the core of the research in Physics. The Big Data revolution presents in this sense the challenges and opportunities for the physicists of today. This workshop will  provide an overview of the possible open problems and research paths in several that physicists of Data can tackle thanks to their training. Topics in Fundamental Physics, Astrophysics, Physics of Complex Systems, Quantum and Machine Learning will be presented through international researchers and young scholars, as well as alumni of the Physics of Data Master.
Food and accommodation in Venice will be covered thanks to the UNIPD grant in teaching innovation.'
