summary: The third spring workshop of Physics of Data with keynote speakers and alumni.
abstract: 'Another great edition of the series of Physis of Data
workshops. This time we had the pleasure to have Dr. Thea Aarestad
(ETH Zurich) and Dr. Sioni Summers (CERN) as keynote speakers. Thea
presented how transformers and variational autoencoders could find an
exciting field of applications in the CMS data analysis; Sioni
illustrated one of the most intriguing challenges at HL-LHC,
i.e. reconstruct at the first trigger level physics objects with
accuracy comparable to what achieved offline. Both seminars were very
much appreciated by the students!'
