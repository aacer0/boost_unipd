Today, a new paper of machine learning applied to medicine has been published in MDPI!
This work explores how machine learning methods, such as Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to analyze a very complex, real-life signal
coming from a wearable device. The instrument, develped by INFN Ferrara, consists of a strain-gauge sensor
that measures changes in the volume of the neck, and aims to
detect the the cerebral venous outflow in the internal jugular veins.
The electronic signal is susceptible to a lot of external factors (e.g. muscle movements of the neck, the patient's position, ...),
complicating the identification of the features in the trace.
In this paper, we demonstrate that with the help of LSTM and CNN models, we can detect artifacts in the signal,
and identify the most important features in the signal with reasonable accuracy, eliminating the need to perform these tasks
manually for each patient.
