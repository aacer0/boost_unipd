The analysis of the CMS data that Rocco and Alberto have been working
on since the last couple of years, i.e. the search for the decay of
the Higgs boson in a final state with a J/Ïˆ and a photon has been
approved and finally made public. The analysis is the first of its
kind and represent a first attempt at directly assessing the coupling
of the Higgs with the Charm quark.
