Gaia has been the first PhD student of the group, collaborating with
us since 2018. She has been the main developer of the NPLM method,
which she made a tool now ready to be deployed in several use
cases. Thanks to her extraordinary work during these years she
received post-doc offers from several prestigious institutions. She
decided to accept the offer of the MIT based AI Institute for
Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions for a 3 years
fellowship. Wishing to continue collaborating with her, we congratulate with Gaia for this excellent result!
