The International Conference on High Energy Physics, the major
conference in HEP, took place in Prague in July. Lorenzo, Sabrina and Rocco 
were there to report results obtained by our group on a few research
lines.
Lorenzo presented the first implementation of quantum-inspired
algorithms (tree tensor networks) on FPGA. Sabrina and Rocco presented
results on behalf of CMS, notably the status of the L1 Trigger Data
Scouting and the analysis of Higgs rare decays.
