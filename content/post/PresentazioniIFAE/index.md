Rocco and Sabrina are presenting their results this week at the Italian conference
on High Energy Physics. Rocco reports about the analysis he and
Alberto are finalizing on Higgs rare decays, in particular the decay
into a J/psi and a photon, whereas Sabrina is showing results from the
40 MHz scouting at CMS.
